***BASIC COMMANDS***

ls(list) = list directory contents

$ ls Downloads/ [List the content of Downloads]

pwd(print working directory) = Prints the current directory you are in 

$ pwd
/home/Chris

cd(Change directory) =Changes the directory

$cd Downloads

Useful option is -f which lets you see new addition to files, useful for looking at files

ln(link) = Make links between files

$ ln [target] [link_name]

Can also be used to make symbolic links(Links that link to another link)

$ ln -s file1.txt file2.txt

***SHELL SHORTCUTS BASH ****
ctrl-a (beginning of line)
ctrl-e (end of line)
ctrl-r (backwards history search)
ctrl-c to interrupt
clear
closing connections/terminals -ctrl-d

poweroff / init 0 / shutdown -h now

***Whats Happening on this machine***

w - Shows who is logged on this system and what they are doing

$ w

Output
user - user name
tty - Terminal type such as pts/0 or console
From - The remote host or IP address
Login@ - Login time
IDLE - Idle time
JCPU - The JCPU time is the time used by all processes attached to the tty. 
PCPU - The PCPU time is the time used by the current process displayed in WHAT field
WHAT - The command line of users current process

top - Display linux processes

$ top

Output (https://www.booleanworld.com/guide-linux-top-command/)
-System time, uptime and user sessions on the first line

-Tasks on the second line, task states are below and how they fall into the 2nd line in top
  total = Total number of processes
  running(R) = Processes that are executing on the CPU or in the run queue ready to be executed[Running]
  Interruptible sleep(D) = Processes that are waiting for an event to complete[Sleeping]
  Uninterruptible sleep(S) = A process that is waiting for an I/O operation to complete[Sleeping]
  Stopped(T) = Processes that have been stoppe dby a job control signal[Stopped]
  Zombie(Z) = Terminated processes whose data structures are still around[Zombie]
  
-Memory Usage ; Split into two parts 
  mem - Physical Memory
  swap - Swap space is a part of the hard disk that is used like RAM. When RAM usage gets too high,
         infrequently used regions of the RAM are written into the swap space. Relying too much on swap hurts system performance
         
-Load Average ; First line
  Explained; A load average of 0.4 means the system is doing only 40% of work it can do. 
             A load average of 1 means that the system is exactly at capacity. 
             
-The Task Area
  PID = Process ID, uniquly identifies a process
  USER = User who started the process
  PR/NI = The NI field shows the "nice" value of a process. The PR field shows scheduling priority from the Kernels view. 
  VIRT = Total ammount of memory consumed by the process
  RES = Memory consumed by the process in RAM
  %MEM = RES value as percentage of total RAM available
  SHR = The ammount of memory shared with other processes
  S = States the process can be in the single letter form
  TIME+ = Total CPU time used by process since it started
  COMMAND = Shows the name of the process

netstat - Print network connections, routing tables, interface statistics

$ netstat

Output explained
  Proto: TCP/UDP
  Recv-Q: How much data is in the queue waiting to be read. Zero is good, non zero is bad
  Send-Q: How much data is in the queue waiting to be sent. Zero is good, non zero is bad
  Local Address: Which hosts and ports the listed sockets are connected, local is always the computer/server you are on
  Foreign Address: The remote computer/server to which the socket is connected. 
  State: Tells in which states the listed sockets are
        Listen(Wait for external computer/server to contact us)
        Established(ready for communication)
        Clos Wait(Remote host closed the connection, local program has not)
  PID/Program Name : Which PID owns the listed socket and the name of the program running in the process with that pid. 
  
  If the Foreign address is *.* the socket is waiting for remote host to send the first data

***PIPES AND REDIRECTION***

Standard input(0) =  A place a program gets information from; by default, the shell directs standard input from the keyboard.
Standard ouput(1) =  A place to which a program can send information
Standard error(2) = Arunning program has a place to send error messages. By default, the shell directs standard error to the screen

[Number in () are file descriptors]

We can redirect these inputs/ouputs using redirection

*Output Redirection using >*

$ echo "this should be in a file" > somefile.txt
[This creates a file with the output of the command ran]

$ echo "this should be in ine two" >> somefile.txt
[This appends the ouput to the created file]

$ tophs 2>error.txt
[Standard Error needs to be manually redirected using the 2 file descriptor. The error.txt contains the error shown on the shell]

*Input redirection using <*

We have a created a file with 4 animals. 
Cats
Zebra
Dogs
Rhino

We can use input redirection to run sort on the file

$ sort < listtosort.txt

Output would then be
Cats
Dogs
Rhino
Zebra

*Pipes*

| (Pipes) = Program 1 feeds output into program 2

$ ps aux | less
[This would run the less command againt the results]

***Filtering Output and Finding Things***

*Logical And or &&*

&& (Logical And) = If program 1 works, program 2 will run. If program 1 fails, program 2 will fail

$ echo "Hello" && echo "Hi sir" 
[Program 1 runs so then program 2 runs]

Hello
Hi sir

*Cut*

cut = remove sections from each line of files

We have a file called fredflintstone.txt with the following lines
one:yabba
two:dabba
three:do

We can use cut to sort these

$ cat fredflintstone.txt | cut -d: f2
yabba
dabba
do

[We specify a delimiter with -d and then the character : Then display field 2

If we did field 1
one
two 
three

*sort*

sort = Sort lines of text files

If we sort the fredflintstone.txt

$ sort fredflintstone.txt
one:yabba
three:do
two:dabba

*uniq*

uniq = report or omit repeated lines

If we modify fredflintstone.txt to have duplicate lines

one:yabba
two:dabba
three:do
three:do

$ uniq fredflintstone.txt

Output would omit the second "three:do"

*wc*

wc = print newline, word, and byte counts for each file

$wc fredflintstone.txt

*grep*

grep = print lines matching a pattern

$ grep one fredflinstone.txt
one:yabba


***PACKAGE MANAGEMENT***

sudo (super User do) = Allows a permitted user to execute command as the superuser(root)
$ sudo apt-get update

apt-get = A package manager for Debian based systems. Does 
Dependency Resolution
Compute which packages need to be downloaded
Download Package files 
Install package Files

$ sudo apt-get update [Find updates]
$ sudo apt-get upgrade [Install updates]

apt-cache = Searches and returns for packages on a Debian system

$ apt-cache search [search phrase]
$ apt-cache search tmux

To install
$ sudo apt-get install tmux [Install]

To remove
$ apt-get remove [Uninstall]

***LINUX FILE PERMISSIONS***

Files and directories have permissions in Linux

-rw-r--r-- 1 root   root      0 Apr 18 12:57 exampleoffile.txt

The permissions are broken into 4 sections
- = Indicates a file (-), a directory (d), or a link (l)
rwx = Read, write, and execute permissions for the owner of the file
r-- = Read, write, and execute permissions for members of the group owning the file
r-- = Read, write, and execute permissions for other users

So taking the file above
- = a file
rw- = Read, write, but not execute for the owner
r-- = Read only for the members of the group owning the file
r-- = Read only for other users

r = read file
w = write file
x = execute file

*Changing Permissions using chmod*

chmod - Change file mode bits

$ chmod 777 somefile.txt

Permissions in numeric mode

0 = No permission
1 = Execute
2= Write
3 = Read

Add up the numbers depending on the level of permission you want to give

0 = ---
1 = --x
2 = -w-
3 = -wx
4 = r-
5 = r-x
6 = rw-
7 = rwx

Permissions in symbolic permissions notation

u = user
g = group
o = other

$ chmod u=rwx, g=rx, o=r somefile.txt

[User can read,write,execute - group can read,execute - other users can read only]

*Change Owner*

chown = Change file owner and group

$ chown [owner] [group]
